Search and download comics from [https://getcomics.info](https://getcomics.info)

**This is very much a work in progress**

Please consider supporting [getcomics](https://getcomics.info/support) in
anyway you can.

## Development

For now you will need to run the application like so

```
$ go run cmd/api/main.go
INFO[0000] server is ready to handle requests at :7575
```

This will start the webserver that runs on port `7575`.
